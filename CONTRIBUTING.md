# Contributing to building blocks

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read relevant sections before making your
contribution. It will smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions.

## I have a question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [documentation](https://docs.valtimo.nl/valtimo-implementation/exchange/building-blocks).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/generiekzaakafhandelcomponent/Bouwblokken/issues)
that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question
in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/generiekzaakafhandelcomponent/Bouwblokken/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting bugs

#### Before submitting a bug report

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of the building block.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment
components/versions (Make sure that you have read the
[documentation](https://docs.valtimo.nl/valtimo-implementation/exchange/building-blocks). If you are looking for support, you
might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there
is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/generiekzaakafhandelcomponent/Bouwblokken/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside the GitHub community have
discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace.
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM).
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output.
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

#### How do I submit a good bug report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue
tracker, or elsewhere in public. Sensitive bugs should instead be sent by email to [support@ritense.com](mailto:support@ritense.com).

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/generiekzaakafhandelcomponent/Bouwblokken/issues/new). Since we can't be sure
at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to
recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem
and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no
obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with
the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as
`critical`), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.

### Suggesting enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for building blocks, **including completely new 
building blocks and minor improvements to existing building blocks**. Following these guidelines will help
maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before submitting an enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of Valtimo.
- Read the [documentation](https://docs.valtimo.nl/valtimo-implementation/exchange/building-blocks#creating-building-blocks)
carefully.
- Find out if the functionality is already covered.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/generiekzaakafhandelcomponent/Bouwblokken/issues) to see if the enhancement
has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How do I submit a good enhancement suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/generiekzaakafhandelcomponent/Bouwblokken/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- Follow the instructions as listed [here](https://docs.valtimo.nl/valtimo-implementation/exchange/building-blocks#how-to-import-a-building-block) when
adding a new building block.

### Adding a new building block
